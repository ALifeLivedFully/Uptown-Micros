heading : "The process and techniques of uptown micros"
description : "I produce microgreens in a temperature controlled room in my apartment in Minneapolis. Because I know exactly what my growing inputs are, I am able to provide food that is both extremely fresh and extremely clean. Microgreens are typically harvested 7-14 days after being seeded, and I deliver directly to customers via bike when weather allows. For those living outside of Minneapolis who are interested in ordering microgreens, a pickup/dropoff location will be given."
