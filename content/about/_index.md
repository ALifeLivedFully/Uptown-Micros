heading : "Why i started Uptown Micros"
description : "I've always felt better knowing where my food comes from, and who helped harvest and grow it. This is the core of Uptown Micros, a way for people in and around Minneapolis to eat healthy food that is both extremely local and very personable. My experience working on small-scale farms has given me the expertise and flexibility needed to run a small urban farm business, and I'm excited to continue growing into the future."
