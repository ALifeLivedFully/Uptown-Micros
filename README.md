# Uptown micros consultation
uptown micros grows and sells microgreens from a Micro-farm based in Minnesota. The owner(Henry) contacted me originally to request that i build a simple 5 page site + contact page, I expressed my willingness to work with his company and asked a few questions about the layout, color scheme, etc. 
When we came to the matter of pricing there seemed to be a disconect with the reality of the price of building a website. as i know the owner personally and want to help him succeed i plan to inform him of the pricing discrepancy and what the industry standards are.

## Industry standards for pricing
The cost of having a simple website built can vary widely based on factors such as complexity, design requirements, and the developer's experience. Here’s a general breakdown:

    Freelancers: For a basic website (like a personal blog or small business site with a few pages), you might expect to pay anywhere from $500 to $2,500. Freelancers often offer more personalized service and flexibility.
    
    Web Design Agencies: Agencies usually charge more, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000 or more for a simple site. The higher cost typically includes a broader range of services, like professional design and additional features.
    
    DIY Platforms: If you’re open to using website builders like Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress.com, you could get a functional website for a fraction of the cost, generally between $100 and $500, depending on the plan and add-ons.

For a basic site, you might start by offering around $500 to $1,000 if you’re working with a freelancer, and adjust based on the specifics of what you need and the expertise of the person or team you're hiring.
